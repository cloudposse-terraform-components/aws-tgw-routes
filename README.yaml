  This component creates a Transit Gateway Route Table and routes for a Transit Gateway VPC Attachment.

usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw/routes:
        vars:
          transit_gateway_route_table_id: "tgw-rtb-0123456789abcdef0"

          # Static routes for specific CIDR blocks
          static_routes:
            - cidr_block: "10.100.0.0/16"
              attachment_id: "tgw-attach-0123456789abcdef0"

          # Route propagation from VPC attachments
          propagated_routes:
            - attachment_id: "tgw-attach-0123456789abcdef1"
              vpc_id: "vpc-0123456789abcdef0"
  ```

  The same configuration using terraform outputs:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw/routes:
        vars:
          transit_gateway_route_table_id: !terraform.output tgw/hub transit_gateway_route_table_id

          # Static routes for specific CIDR blocks
          static_routes:
            - cidr_block: !terraform.output vpc edge-vpc vpc_cidr
              attachment_id: !terraform.output tgw/attachment edge-vpc transit_gateway_attachment_id

          # Route propagation from VPC attachments
          propagated_routes:
            - attachment_id: !terraform.output tgw/attachment app-vpc transit_gateway_attachment_id
              vpc_id: !terraform.output vpc app-vpc vpc_id
  ```

  ### Multiple Environment Example

  For environments with multiple routing requirements, here's an example using physical IDs:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw/routes/nonprod:
        metadata:
          component: tgw/routes
        vars:
          transit_gateway_route_table_id: "tgw-rtb-0123456789abcdef1"

          # Static routes for specific destinations
          static_routes:
            - cidr_block: "10.20.0.0/16"
              attachment_id: "tgw-attach-0123456789abcdef2"
            - cidr_block: "10.30.0.0/16"
              attachment_id: "tgw-attach-0123456789abcdef3"

          # Enable route propagation from specific VPCs
          propagated_routes:
            - attachment_id: "tgw-attach-0123456789abcdef4"
              vpc_id: "vpc-0123456789abcdef1"
            - attachment_id: "tgw-attach-0123456789abcdef5"
              vpc_id: "vpc-0123456789abcdef2"
  ```

  The same configuration using terraform outputs:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw/routes/nonprod:
        metadata:
          component: tgw/routes
        vars:
          transit_gateway_route_table_id: !terraform.output tgw/hub transit-use1-nonprod transit_gateway_route_table_id

          # Static routes for specific destinations
          static_routes:
            - cidr_block: !terraform.output vpc dev-use1-edge vpc_cidr
              attachment_id: !terraform.output tgw/attachment dev-use1-edge transit_gateway_attachment_id
            - cidr_block: !terraform.output vpc staging-use1-edge vpc_cidr
              attachment_id: !terraform.output tgw/attachment staging-use1-edge transit_gateway_attachment_id

          # Enable route propagation from specific VPCs
          propagated_routes:
            - attachment_id: !terraform.output tgw/attachment dev-use1-network transit_gateway_attachment_id
              vpc_id: !terraform.output vpc dev-use1-network vpc_id
            - attachment_id: !terraform.output tgw/attachment staging-use1-network transit_gateway_attachment_id
              vpc_id: !terraform.output vpc staging-use1-network vpc_id
  ```

  ### Important Notes

  1. **Static Routes vs Propagated Routes**:
     - Use static routes for specific CIDR destinations
     - Use route propagation for dynamic routing from attached VPCs
     - Blackhole routes can be created to drop traffic to specific CIDRs

  2. **Route Table Management**:
     - Each Transit Gateway can have multiple route tables
     - Route tables can be associated with specific VPC attachments
     - Route propagation enables automatic route sharing

  3. **Best Practices**:
     - Keep prod and nonprod routing separate
     - Document route purposes and dependencies
     - Use clear naming conventions for route tables
     - Consider using blackhole routes for security
